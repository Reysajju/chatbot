# ChatBot

Welcome to the ChatBot project! This simple Python script implements a basic chatbot using Hugging Face's Transformers library.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the ChatBot
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
Run the chatbot script:


python chatbot_backend.py
The chatbot will greet you, and you can start interacting with it. Type "bye," "quit," or "exit" to end the chat.

Customization
Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs. You can explore different pre-trained models from Hugging Face's Transformers library and add more features to enhance the chatbot's functionality.
